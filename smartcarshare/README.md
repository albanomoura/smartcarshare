SmartCarShare

SmartCarShare started in 2010 as an informal car sharing system amongst friends. With the success and continuous improvement of the sharing process, the company started building itself as a proper company in 2013 with a client-side system and initial documentation of its processes and products. From that point to where it stands now, the company has rapidly grown and is currently in an expansion process. In this specific moment of a companyâ€™s transition, where improving processes, reducing costs and making the company more effective to handle bigger challenges, the system becomes an essential part. However, the software and system still have a small-size focus and need to be replaced by an integrated system that brings reliability and new technologies. This is the vision  and achievement this document describes.
